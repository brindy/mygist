# MyGist

A simple 'gist' server for personal use or use within a corporate firewall.

This project is in it's early days and isn't functional just yet.  However, it's still a reasonable demonstration of how to use OSGi to make extendable Vaadin apps.  

Note: This uses Vaadin OSGi (2.0.0) add on that has not been officially released yet.

## Running

* Get Eclipse
* Install bndtools 2.0+
* Clone the project
* Open the projects
